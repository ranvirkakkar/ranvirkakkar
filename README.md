## Hi there 👋
I'm [Ranvir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranvir-kakkar-65b429314/), a full-stack web developer based in India.

I design and build whatever feels exciting to me. If I have a cool idea I'm most probably gonna build it.

My main tech stack is react, express, mongoDB (MERN), next.js and typescript.

Programming languages I know are javascript and python.

My favorite tools are figma, vs-code, postman, docker.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [Mini Crossword](https://our-crossword.netlify.app/)

Fun facts: 
 *  I am a gamer at heart
 *  I gain a buff from music
